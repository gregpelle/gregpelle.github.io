Last month I ordered a [Kamado Joe Big Joe 3](https://www.kamadojoe.com/products/big-joe-iii).  While I realized it would be large, I was not prepared for how large.  That is a lot of ceramic.

I continue to work out how much charcoal I need to use at any one time.  Currently I am using too much and will be reducing the amount.

My [Kamado Joe Jr](https://www.kamadojoe.com/products/joe-jr-with-cast-iron-stand) uses 1/2 a 2 gallon homer bucket but I have only used it for high heat grilling.

My current thinking is to use a full 2 gallon homer bucket worth of charcoal in the  BJ3 and see if that is enough to high heat grill.
